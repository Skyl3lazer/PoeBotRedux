PoeBot, now in C# Form

Path of Exile IRC Bot

A simple IRC bot, reworked in C# and no longer race-centric (since rip races). It's now mainly a guild management tool for the SA poe guild.

Not reccomended to use vanilla, you'll have to do a bit of hacking together. Requires a local DB with appropriate schema. Also you know, does everything via SA id.
